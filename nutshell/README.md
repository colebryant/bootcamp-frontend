# Nutshell: The Information Dashboard

Nutshell is a new product offering that our group at NSS was tasked with building. It's a dashboard for people to use to organize their daily tasks, events, news article, friends, and chat messages. I worked on the events feature in addition to the ERD.

### Accessing the App
To run Nutshell locally, create an empty directory and clone the project by running the following command in your terminal: ``` git@github.com:colebryant/nutshell-divine-madness.git ```

Go to the ```src/lib``` folder in the project and run: ```npm init```

Run the following command to install all libraries and their dependencies: ```npm install```

To run Nutshell in the browser, run: ```grunt```

Open your preferred browser and go to: [http://localhost:8080/]( http://localhost:8080/)

In another window of your terminal traverse into ```src/api``` and run: ```json-server -p 8088 -w database.json```

1. Functions
